**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
The core problem is to create a digital, console-based version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows a single human player to compete against a computer-controlled opponent (AI). The system must be reliable, easy to use, and demonstrate a logical, modular structure.

**SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:**
The scope of this project includes:

Designing a command-line based Rock–Paper–Scissors game.

Implementing core game logic for determining wins, losses, and ties.

Allowing the user to input their choice and validating the input.

Generating a random computer choice using Python’s built-in modules.

Providing clear feedback to the player after each round.

Optionally supporting multiple rounds, scorekeeping, or replay functionality.

**TARGET USERS:**
Beginner programmers learning Python fundamentals.

Students practicing conditional statements, loops, and functions.

Casual players who want a quick and simple game to pass time.

Educators who need example projects for teaching programming.

Developers looking for a base template to build more advanced versions (e.g., GUI, multiplayer, scoring systems).

**HIGH LEVEL FEATURES:**
4. High-Level Features

The core features of the Rock–Paper–Scissors project include:

✔ User Input Handling

Accepts user choices (e.g., “rock”, “paper”, “scissors”).

Includes validation to prevent invalid inputs.

✔ Random Computer Move Generation

Uses Python’s random module to generate unbiased computer choices.

✔ Win/Loss/Tie Determination

Compares the player’s move against the computer’s.

Displays the outcome in a clear, friendly format.

✔ Replay Option

Allows the user to play multiple rounds (if implemented).

May track wins, losses, and ties.

✔ Error Handling

Prevents crashes due to unexpected input.

Provides user-friendly prompts and messages.

✔ Simple and Portable

Runs on any system with Python 3 installed.

No external libraries required (unless you added enhancements).
